# Java Banking Management System

The Java Banking Management System is a comprehensive application developed using JavaFX, Maven, JUnit, and File I/O. It provides a secure and efficient solution for managing bank accounts and transactions.

## Key Features

- **Secure Login Page:** The system incorporates a robust login page that ensures the security of user credentials. It allows for retrieval and creation of user credentials, providing a secure authentication process.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The system follows object-oriented programming principles to enhance code modularity, reusability, and maintainability. This approach allows for a structured and organized implementation of various banking functionalities.

- **Object-Oriented Design (OOD):** By adhering to object-oriented design principles, the system ensures a clear separation of concerns and promotes code readability. OOD enables the development of scalable and extensible code architecture.

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design:** The system adopts the MVC design pattern to separate the application's logic into three distinct components: the model, view, and controller. This design pattern enhances code organization, maintainability, and testability.

- **DRY and SOLID Principles:** The system follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) principles. These principles promote code reusability, modularity, and flexibility, resulting in a more robust and maintainable codebase.

- **Bank Account Management:** The system allows users to create new bank accounts, view existing accounts, and perform various account-related operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers. Users can seamlessly manage their bank accounts using the intuitive user interface.
